        <p>In the interview with Brainster and the briefing I received, we came to the conclusion that complete desktop / mobile solutions should be made for the front page of Brainster Next, as well as for the two landing pages for study programs.</p>

    <div class="competitiveAnalysis">

        <h2 class="title">Competitive analysis</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this Competitive Analysis is to gain insight into what direct and indirect competitors have to offer and to make the most intuitive and superior design in order to stand out from the crowd and attract candidates. With this analysis, I will identify the strengths and weaknesses of each competitor. The main purpose of the website will be conversions and applications from candidates. For direct competitors I chose: Algebra from Croatia, DOBA from Slovenia, Vern from Croatia, American College from Bulgaria, Higher School for Professional Studies in Information Technology ITS from Serbia. The reason why these schools were chosen is that they are comparable to Brainster Next in size or curriculum and geolocation. The analysis will be based on the following criteria: Navigation, Content Features, Primary Content, Secondary Content, Study View</p>

            <h3 class="title">Univerzitet Metropolitan</h3>
            <p> According to the research I did on the site, the main focus is on news and events, and the study options. They use bright and soft colors on their website. The content of the home screen is news and events, study options, how they can study, messages from the dean, where they are employed, student success, location and contact, partners, and application. The directions page shows basic information, why to study, what you will learn and what you will  do, partners, about the program, prices, enrollment, and news. The main focus is on the program and safe work.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Algebra University College</h3>
            <p>They use dark and bold colors on their website. The main focus is on the study programs and what you get after graduation. The content of the home screen is study programs, enrollment steps, college news, where they can study, what the students say, news, and news about the faculty. The content of the page for the study programs is an introduction to the program, what you will learn, employment partners, what the students say, news about the faculty.

            <h3 class="title">Conclusion competitive analysis</h3>
            <p>From this analysis, we concluded that the main focus of almost all competitors is the program of study and guaranteed work after graduation. Content is present in different ways, some faculties use only text and images, some also links to other pages, and others video content to display their information.</p>

    <div class="Interviews">

        <h2 class="title">Interviews with users</h2>

        <p>For the purpose of the research, I developed a list of questions for both future students and their parents. These interviews helped me to understand their experience, desires, and frustrations from the previous use of existing websites of different faculties. I applied all this to make the design for Brainster Next.</p>
        
        <p>From the interviews of the high school students, I learned that the main purpose of their visit to the websites is to find out more information about the subjects, the duration of the studies, and the enrollment deadlines. The basic information they search for usually is enrollment information, courses, and professors. According to the previous experience they had from the reviews on various web pages of the faculties, as a negative experience they mention the overcrowding of information on the first page,  no students testimonial, and insufficient data on the enrollment procedure.</p>
        
        <p>From the interviews of the parents, I learned that the main purpose of their visit to the websites is to find out what the faculty has to offer. The basic information they search for is usually the program and the way of teaching, and the conditions for enrollment. We would like to faculty to have modern laboratories for learning, they think that the conditions are more important than the cost of studies and like to have communication with the teaching staff. According to the previous experience they had from reviews on various web pages of the faculties, as a negative experience, they mention the complicated websites, overloaded with information, the way of studying is not shown, insufficient data on the enrollment procedure.</p>

    <div class="Conclusion">
        <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As a result of all the information, I decided that the most important thing is the design of the website to be minimalist, intuitive, and easy to use.  There shouldn't be too much information and the focus to be on the presentation of the program of study and the necessary skills that are in demand in today's labor market. In that way, the user can get all the necessary information easily and quickly.</p>
